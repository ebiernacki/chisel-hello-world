# Hardware Hello World
Author: Eric Biernacki (ebiernacki@wustl.edu)

This Repo was created as a base starter code for Chisel HDL projects and was larger taken from the hello world repo by Martin Schoeberl (martin@jopdesign.com)  (https://github.com/schoeberl/chisel-examples/tree/master/hello-world)

Make sure you have followed the tutorials for downloading and installing the proper JDK, sbt, and Scala Metals tools

Once you have cloned the repo and opened this repo dont forget to import the sbt build for the Scala Metals tools!

The hello.scala file just prints hello world to the terminal 

The other is a Counter module to test verilog and vcd waveform file generation
