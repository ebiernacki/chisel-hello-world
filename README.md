Author: Eric Biernacki (ebiernacki@wustl.edu)

This Repo was created as a base starter code for Chisel HDL projects and was larger taken from the hello world repo by Martin Schoeberl (martin@jopdesign.com)  ([link](https://github.com/schoeberl/chisel-examples/tree/master/hello-world)https://github.com/schoeberl/chisel-examples/tree/master/hello-world)

Make sure you have followed the tutorials for downloading and installing the proper JDK, sbt, and Scala Metals tools

Once you have cloned the repo and opened this repo, import the sbt build and open a new terminal to test the functionality

The helloworld.scala is just printing hello world to the terminal 

The other is a logic ciruit to test gtk wave
